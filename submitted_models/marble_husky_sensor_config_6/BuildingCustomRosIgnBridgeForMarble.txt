# Building custom ros_ign_bridge to make pan/tilt gimbal work (on marble vehicles):

First, follow instructions for building from source on this page:
https://github.com/realdealneil/ros_ign/tree/melodic/ros_ign_bridge

Except, use the following clone URL instead:
git clone https://github.com/realdealneil/ros_ign.git -b melodic

Once you've built, you will need to stack your workspace (subt workspace)
on top of this workspace.  To do this, do as follows:

```
cd ~/subt_ws
rm -rf build devel install
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
source ~/bridge_ws/install/setup.bash
catkin_make install
```

Alternatively, you can clone the above repo directly inside of subt repo 
and do a clean build.  I have issued pull request on ros_ign_bridge and
once that has made its way into subt, this will no longer be necessary.
